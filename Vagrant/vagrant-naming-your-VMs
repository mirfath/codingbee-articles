You can assign a name to your VM, both in what's displayed by the vagrant output, and also on the Oracle Virtualbox gui.


<pre>
config.vm.define :puppetmaster-abc do |puppetmaster_config|        # this names it for vagrant
  puppetmaster_config.vm.hostname = "puppetmaster.codingbee.dyndns.org"
  puppetmaster_config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v, override|
    v.name = "puppetmaster-def"                                     # this names it for oracle gui
  end
end

</pre>
