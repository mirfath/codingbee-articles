There are 3 common things you may want to undo when using git:


<ul>
	<li>undo a commit</li>
	<li>unstage a file</li>
	<li>unmodify a file</li>
</ul>



If you have done several commits and you want to roll back several commits, then do:


<pre>git log -p</pre>


This will list commit id's pick the id you want to roll back to, then do:

<pre>
git reset --hard e0e7671b58895cfa1bbca4016238c693efaa4fbe
</pre>

This will rollback to a commit with the id above. Be careful with this command, because you cannot undo this.
