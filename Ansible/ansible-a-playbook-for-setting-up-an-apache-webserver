Here's a simple playbook that set's up an apache webserver:
<pre>
[root@controller playbooks]# pwd
/root/playbooks
[root@controller playbooks]# cat httpd.yaml
---
- name: This sets up an httpd webserver
  hosts: ansibleclient01.local
  tasks:
  - name: Install the httpd rpm
    yum: name=httpd
  - name: start the httpd service
    service: name=httpd state=started
  - name: Open port 80
    firewalld: service=http permanent=true state=enabled
  - name: start the firewalld service
    service: name=firewalld state=restarted
</pre>

Here's a breakdown of what the aboout yaml syntax shows. At the top level is a single item list. This list item houses a hash with 3 key-value pairs. The first to key's values are of the type string. However the third key's (tasks) houses a list of 4 items. Each one of these list items contains a hash. Each of these hashes is made up of 2 key-value pairs.

Now let's run this playbook:
<pre>
[root@controller playbooks]# pwd
/root/playbooks
[root@controller playbooks]# ls
httpd.yaml
$ ansible-playbook httpd.yml

</pre>
We can test if this has worked, by opening to http://ansibleclient01.local in your web browser.
