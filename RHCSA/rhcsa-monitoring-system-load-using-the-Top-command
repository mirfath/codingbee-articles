If you want to see how much load your machine is under, then we use the top command:


<pre>
$ top
</pre>

This gives real-time-updating output of:



<pre>
top - 22:07:24 up  2:54,  2 users,  <strong>load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05</strong>

On the first line we have a "load average" entry, followed by 3 values.

These values shows the average number of processes in the queue (waiting to be allocated a cpu) in the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes respectively. If these values are successfully increasing then it means that the machine's load is declining. However if it is successively increasing then it means that the machine load is increasing.


By default, the top command only lists the top 30 or so processes, order by cpu usage. If you want to use top to monitor certain processes, then you can do:
<pre>
$ top –p {pid1},{pid2},{pid3},...etc
</pre>

This will only list the process with the given pid values, which makes it easier to work with, when you are interested in some particular processes. .

Top is an interactive utility and While in "top" mode, if you then select “h”, you will find various options available:

There is also a tui version of the top command called htop. Which you need to install:

<pre>

</pre>

Then do:
