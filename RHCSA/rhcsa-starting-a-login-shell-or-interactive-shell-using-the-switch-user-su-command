All the following let's you switch user, and switch into a login shell:

<ul>
	<li><code>su - {username}</code></li>
	<li><code>su -l {username}</code></li>
	<li><code>su --login {username}</code></li>
</ul>


Note: you can omit {username}, in which case the "su" command will use the default username, which is "root".


If you want to su into an interactive shell, you do:


<pre>
$ su {username}
</pre>

Once again, you can omit {username} to imply the root user.

In most cases you would log in using login shells.
