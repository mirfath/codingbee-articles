<h2>Overview</h2>
By the end of this article you should be able to answer the following questions:

During machine boot, if you edit the grub parameters just so to enter the rescue/emergency, then you will still get prompted to enter the root password. That's why we take a different approach to reset the root password. When you machine is booting up:

<ol>
	<li>Press down then up arrow keys as soon as the kernel selection menu appears. This will pause the boot process</li>
	<li>press "e" in order to edit your grub parameter settings.</li>
	<li>Scroll down to the <code>linux16</code> line, then press the "end" key to reach the end of that line.</li>
	<li>add <code>rd.break</code> at the end of the "linux16" line.</li>
</ol>

The rd.break setting instructs the boot process to stop at a specific point during the initramfs process. This is a point where just the main core filesystem has been mounted, but none of the other filesystems have been mounted.


Tip: also good idea to remove the "rhgb quiet" flags from the grub parameter list so that you can monitor what is happening.


Then do "ctrl+x", to resume the boot process with the modified grub parameter input.

After that you'll see:


<a href="http://codingbee.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/rtNViYv.png"><img src="http://codingbee.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/rtNViYv.png" alt="" width="739" height="420" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4631" /></a>




Next we have to run a series of specific commands, first we run:


<pre>
switch_root:/# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
</pre>

This is to make our root filesystem mount writable. Our root filesystem is currently "/sysroot", that's because we are so early in the boot process. Also at this early stage it is set to read-only mode.


Next we run:

<pre>
switch_root:/# chroot /sysroot
</pre>

This temporarily makes "/sysroot" our root directory instead of "/". This has the affect of changing the command prompt to:

<a href="http://codingbee.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1t1CPgR.png"><img src="http://codingbee.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1t1CPgR.png" alt="" width="735" height="414" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4633" /></a>

Now we can set the new password by running the following command:


<pre>
sh-4.2# echo NewPassword | passwd --stdin root
</pre>

Here my new root password will become "NewPassword"

Note: rather than running the above command. You can instead use the passwd command in the normal way.

Finally we run the following command:


<pre>
sh-4.2# touch /.autorelabel
</pre>

Now we exit out of chroot:


<pre>
$ exit
</pre>


You should now see something like this:


<a href="http://codingbee.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BYIOeSA.png"><img src="http://codingbee.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BYIOeSA.png" alt="" width="744" height="423" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4635" /></a>

Then exit again to reboot the system:

<pre>
$ exit
</pre>

<strong>The reboot may take about 2 minutes, which is normal</strong>. That is why you should remove the "rhgb quiet" as suggested so that you can monitor the boot process.

Now the machine shout reboot and you should then be able to login using your root user's new password.
