Swap disks are a special type of storage that is designed to act like extra ram on a machine. This is handy if your machine is running low on ram. To see your ram info, you use the <em>free</em> command:


<pre>
$ free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            993         517         306          13         169         314
Swap:          1023         217         806
</pre>

Here you can see how much swap memory is currently active.


You can make a swap disk out of either a disk partition, or from an LV. The approach varies slight with each approach.

<h2>Create a Swap disk from a disk partition</h2>

First you need to create a partition, that is of the "Linux swap" partition type:

Next we need to install the "swap filesystem":

<pre>
$ mkswap -L {swap-name} /dev/sdb1
mkswap: /dev/sdb1: warning: wiping old xfs signature.
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 102396 KiB
no label, UUID=2e80abd8-ee86-4d06-b1b5-09ad66d17cc0
$
</pre>
Note: assigning a name with "-L" is optional, but is definitely recommended. Next we can activate the swap using the swapon command:

<pre>
$ swapon /dev/sdb1
</pre>

You can then check this has worked using the <code>free -m</code> command.

To list all your active swap disks, you can do:

<pre>
$ swapon -s
Filename                                Type            Size    Used    Priority
/dev/dm-1                               partition       1048572 224464  -1
/dev/sdb1                               partition       102396  0       -2
</pre>

Note: this doesn't list inactive swaps. It only list active swaps only.


You can also deactivate the swap with the swapoff command:

<pre>
$ swapoff /dev/sdb1
</pre>

Another way to deactivate the swap space is by rebooting the machine. That's because activating a swap using "swapon" isn't persistant. To make it persistant, you have to add it to the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file. More about this later.


<h2>Create a Swap disk from a Logical Volume</h2>

First you create an LV, unless you already have one available.

<pre>
$ mkswap /dev/vg-name/lv-name
</pre>

Then you can use enable/disable swaps as shown earlier.


<h2>Automouniting swap disks</h2>
If you want the new swap to become active at boot time, then you need add the new swap to the fstab file, here are the entries that you need to add:


col 1: “LABEL={swap’s nickname}”  or "UUID=..."

col 2: swap       # since mount-points are not applicable for swaps.

col 3: swap       # Since filesystems like ext4 are not applicable.

col 4: defaults

col 5: 0          # since you don’t need to keep backups of temp data.

col 6: 0          # since you don’t need to do fsck because it will only contain temp data


You can test whether you have entered everything in fstab correctly by running the following command:


<pre>
$ swapon -a
</pre>

Here swapon will read the fstab file and start all swaps it can find.

You can then use <code>free -m</code> and <code>swapon -s</code> to check everything is as expected.

Likewise, to turn off all swaps listed in the fstab file, you do:

<pre>
$ swapoff -a
</pre>









Creating a swap partition is quite similar to how you create a filesystem partition, here's a side-by-side comparison of the 2 processes:
