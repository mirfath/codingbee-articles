The policy book can be thought of as a really big text book, which contains 3 chapters.

Chapter 1 - Contains a list of all available security attributes. There are actually  4 lists, one for each type of the differnt types of suecurity attributes user:role:type:level. In the targeted policy, the "type" list is by far the longest, containing about 4500 entries.
Chapter 2 - lists mapping rules about which security attribute can access to which other security attributes.
chapter 3 - list selinux context assignment rules. This chapter gives info about what SELinux needs, in order to determine what selinux context values every object in your machine should have.
