A lot of commands have an option "-Z" that that is specifically for displaying an object's security context. Here's a quick overview of the main ones.


<h2>Viewing a user's SELinux context</h2>
This is done using the id command:


<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
[root@localhost ~]# id -Z
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
</pre>




<h2>Viewing a file's/folder's security context</h2>
As shown earlier this is done using the ls command:

<pre>
$ touch testfile.txt
$ ls -lZ testfile.txt
-rw-r--r--. root root unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 testfile.txt
</pre>


<h2>Viewing a process's security context</h2>
A processes SELinux context can be viewed using the ps command:


<pre>
$ ps -Z
LABEL                             PID TTY          TIME CMD
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 1662 pts/0 00:00:00 bash
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 2059 pts/0 00:00:00 systemctl
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 2060 pts/0 00:00:00 less
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 2352 pts/0 00:00:00 ps

</pre>


as well as the netstat command:


<pre>
$ netstat -Z | head

...etc

Notice in all cases, they show all 4 parts, using ":" as a delimiter, and they show all the parts in the order of: <code>user:role:type:level</code>.

You'll notice that the user security contect attribute, always ends with "_u" suffix, and in a similar fashion for role we have (_r), and for type we have (_t). However for the level have a prefix of "s", which indicates (s)ensitivity.
