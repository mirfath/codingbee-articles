For services like ftp of httpd, you may configure them to use:

- different default directory for storing your data
- different port number to listen on


In these scenarios you need to add policy rules to make this work.



For custom port numbers, you will need to run a command like this:


<pre>
$ semanage -port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp {custom port number}
</pre>

Note: sealert should be able to suggest this.
