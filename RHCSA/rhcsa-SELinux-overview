<h2>What is SELinux?</h2>
SELinux is a system that is primarily used for protecting your machine from potential attacks from the internet.  For example there are a lot of programs, e.g. apache that comes with it's own service-account e.g. "httpd". Hackers may be able to find a way to take control of that service-account and thereby gain access to other, assets, e.g. files, folders, process,..etc. This crucially includes being able to access not apache related assets. For example the apache user has read access to the /etc directory:


 <pre>
$ ls -l / | grep etc
drwxr-xr-x. 143 root    root    8192 Oct 14 17:33 etc
</pre>

Therefore if the httpd service account has been compromised, then the attacker can use this account to look inside this directory (along with lots of other places), in order to malicious activities.

In this situation the traditional ugo+rwx permission just doesn't offer a way to combat this kind of vulnerability. And that is where SELinux comes to the rescue.

SELinux essentially does damage control. That is, if the apache service account has been compromised, then the attacker can only access files+folders that the apache service account would normally need access to. Therefore an attacker (while masquarading as the apache user) won't be able to access a folder, such as the "/etc" folder even if the httpd service account has the necessary ugo+rwx privileges for this folder.

In later article we'll cover later how SELinux manages to achieve this kind of granular access control. In the meantime the following man page gives a short overview of SELinux:

<pre>
$ man selinux
</pre>

The only situation where you might not need SELinux, is if your machine does not have internet access.


<h2>Layers of Security</h2>
To make a machine secure, you add "layers" of security. SELinux is essentially just another layer of security.

In Linux, there are different several layers of security, e.g. firewall, ugo+rwx, dmz, password policies, encryption, authentication....etc.  However all these layers doesn't harden security at the OS level. But SELinux does, in fact it's support is built into the kernel. That is why it is referred to as a <strong>Mandatory Access Control</strong>, aka MAC.

All the other security layers, e.g. ugo+rwx and firewalls, are referred to as <strong>Discretionary Access Control</strong> (aka DAC). All DAC layers are vulnerable to human error. For example the root user who can inadvertently open up vulnerabilities. Whereas SELinux cannot accidentally be made vulnerable by mistake.

So how do all these DAC and MAC layers work together? When one objects (e.g. a process) attempts to access another object (e.g. config file), then this requests first needs to be approved by all the DAC security layers, and after that it finally needs to get approved by the mac ( SELinux) layer. Access is permitted once the request is permitted by all the security layers..






<h2>Handy SELinux related utilities</h2>

Here are some relevant SELinux utilities that you should install:

<ul>
	<li>policycoreutils-python</li>
	<li>policycoreutils-gui</li>
	<li>setools-console</li>
	<li>setools-gui</li>
	<li>setroubleshoot</li>
	<li>setroubleshoot-server</li>
</ul>



I.e. we do:


<pre>
$ yum install policycoreutils-python policycoreutils-gui setools-console setools-gui setroubleshoot setroubleshoot-server

</pre>

Here's a quick description of each of these:


<pre>
$ yum info policycoreutils-python | grep "Description" -A1
Description : The policycoreutils-python package contains the management tools
            : use to manage an SELinux environment.


$ yum info policycoreutils-gui | grep "^Description" -A1
Description : system-config-selinux is a utility for managing the SELinux
            : environment


$ yum info setools-console | grep "^Description" -A7
Description : SETools is a collection of graphical tools, command-line tools,
            : and libraries designed to facilitate SELinux policy analysis.
            :
            : This package includes the following console tools:
            :
            :   secmds          command line tools: seinfo, sesearch
            :   sediff          semantic policy difference tool


$ yum info setools-gui | grep "^Description" -A7
Description : SETools is a collection of graphical tools, command-line tools,
            : and libraries designed to facilitate SELinux policy analysis.
            :
            : This package includes the following graphical tools:
            :
            :   apol          policy analysis tool
            :   seaudit       audit log analysis tool


$ yum info setroubleshoot | grep "^Description" -A8
Description : setroubleshoot GUI. Application that allows you to view
            : setroubleshoot-server messages.
            : Provides tools to help diagnose SELinux problems. When AVC
            : messages are generated an alert can be generated that will give
            : information about the problem and help track its resolution.
            : Alerts can be configured to user preference. The same tools can be
            : run on existing log files.


$ yum info setroubleshoot-server | grep "^Description" -A8
Description : Provides tools to help diagnose SELinux problems. When AVC
            : messages are generated an alert can be generated that will give
