<h2>Checking for any available NFS shares</h2>
In our scenario we know that The-Server is sharing folders via the NFS and CIFS/Samba technology.

Before we can access The-Server's nfs shared folder, we first see what folders The-Server has made available for sharing via nfs. To do this we first need to install:

<pre>
$ yum install nfs-utils
</pre>



This package installs a few things including <code>showmount</code> command. This command is used to query nfs servers to see what folders it's sharing via nfs (if any). In our scenario we'll use it to check what folder The-Server has made available for sharing:

<pre>
$ showmount -e The-Server
Export list for The-Server:
/nfs/Shared-Folder *
</pre>

As indicated The-Server has made the folder "/nfs/Shared-Folder" available for sharing via nfs. We'll cover access to this Share-Folder later on.



<h2>Check for any available CIFS shares</h2>

First you need to install the samba client:

<pre>
$ yum install samba-client cifs-utils
</pre>

Now to check for available CIF shares, you need to have a valid samba user credential. Let's assume we have valid credentials of a user called "vagrant", then to check if there are any available CIF shares we run the following command:


<pre>
$ smbclient -L The-Server --user vagrant
Enter vagrant's password:
Domain=[MYGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.1.12]

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
<strong>        Shared-Folder   Disk</strong>
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba Server Version 4.1.12)
        vagrant         Disk      Home Directories
Domain=[MYGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.1.12]

        Server               Comment
        ---------            -------

        Workgroup            Master
        ---------            -------
</pre>


<h2>Accessing shared folders by "mounting" them</h2>

So far we have determined that The-Server has made 2 folders available for sharing. The first folder is being shared via NFS, whereas the second folder is being shared via CIFS (aka samba). In both cases the folder called Share-Folder.

We can now access these folders by "mounting" them.




<h3>Configuring the The-Client machine to access the NFS Shared-Folder</h3>

Now that we know that The-Server is sharing folders via nfs, we now need to create a folder that will act as our local representation of the Shared-Folder. We'll call it:

<pre>
$ mkdir -p /nfs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
</pre>

Notice that we used a meaningful folder structure so to make it easy to track, this is best practice. If we take a look inside this folder then it should be empty:

<pre>
$ cd /nfs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
$ ls -l
</pre>


This folder is referred to as a "mount-mount". Next we "mount" The-Server's Shared-Folder onto our mountpoint, which effectively makes the Shared-Folder's content accessible. This is done using the <code>mount</code> command.

<pre>
$ mount -t nfs The-Server:/nfs/Shared-Folder /nfs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
</pre>

Now to check if this command has worked, we do:

<pre>
$ mount | grep The-Server
The-Server:/nfs/Shared-Folder on /nfs/The-Server/Shared-Folder type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.0,rsize=131072,wsize=131072,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,port=0,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=192.168.50.10,local_lock=none,addr=192.168.50.11)
</pre>

Another way to check this has worked, is by using the df command:


<pre>
$ df -h
Filesystem                            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/centos_puppetmaster-root   38G  4.7G   33G  13% /
devtmpfs                              487M     0  487M   0% /dev
tmpfs                                 497M   80K  497M   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs                                 497M  6.9M  490M   2% /run
tmpfs                                 497M     0  497M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda1                             497M  125M  373M  26% /boot
none                                  224G  135G   89G  61% /vagrant
<strong>The-Server:/nfs/Shared-Folder       38G  3.9G   34G  11% /nfs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
</strong>
</pre>



Now, lets navigate into this folder and see what it contains:

<pre>
$ cd /nfs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
$ ls -l
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 26 Oct 24 20:14 subfolder
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  0 Oct 24 20:14 testfile1.txt
$ tree
.
├── subfolder
│   └── testfile2.txt
└── testfile1.txt

1 directory, 2 files

</pre>


As you can see, when you access the mount-point, you actually end up accessing the contents of The-Server's Shared-Folder.

However the above mounting isn't persistant, i.e. it won't survive a reboot. In the next article We'll cover how to make it persistent by setting up automounting during machine's boot up.




<h3>Configuring the The-Client machine to access the CIFS Shared-Folder</h3>

Like nfs, we first create a mountpoint:

<pre>
$ mkdir -p /cifs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
</pre>

As before, we create a meaningful folder structure, to make things easier to track.

Now we use the mount command again, but this time it looks like this:


<pre>
$ mount -t cifs -o user=vagrant,password=admin <mark>//</mark>The-Server/Shared-Folder /cifs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
</pre>

Note we must use this <code>//</code> syntax, otherwise it won't work. Also we don't need to know of the remote folder's fullpath, just the folder name itself is required.


We can now confirm that this has worked using the mount command:


<pre>
$ mount | grep cifs
//The-Server/Shared-Folder on /cifs/The-Server/Shared-Folder type cifs (rw,relatime,vers=1.0,cache=strict,username=vagrant,domain=THE-SERVER,uid=0,noforceuid,gid=0,noforcegid,addr=192.168.50.11,unix,posixpaths,serverino,acl,rsize=1048576,wsize=65536,actimeo=1)
</pre>

You can also check with the df command:

<pre>
$ df -h
Filesystem                            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/centos_puppetmaster-root   38G  4.7G   33G  13% /
devtmpfs                              487M     0  487M   0% /dev
tmpfs                                 497M   80K  497M   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs                                 497M  6.9M  490M   2% /run
tmpfs                                 497M     0  497M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda1                             497M  125M  373M  26% /boot
none                                  224G  135G   89G  61% /vagrant
The-Server:/nfs/Shared-Folder       38G  3.9G   34G  11% /nfs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
<strong>//The-Server/Shared-Folder          38G  3.9G   34G  11% /cifs/The-Server/Shared-Folder</strong>
</pre>


Now let's go into the folder and see what it contains:

<pre>
$ cd /cifs/The-Server/Shared-Folder
$ ls -l
total 0
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 Oct 24 22:31 hello-world-cifs.txt
drwxrwxrwx. 2 root root 0 Oct 24 22:31 subfolder
$ tree
.
├── hello-world-cifs.txt
└── subfolder
    └── another-testfile.txt

1 directory, 2 files
</pre>

However the above mounting isn't persistent, i.e. it won't survive a reboot. We'll cover how to make it persisting by setting up automounting during machine boot up.
