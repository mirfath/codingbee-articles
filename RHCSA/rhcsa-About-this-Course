This course covers everything you need to know in order to pass the official Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) exam.

There are a lot of different Linux Operating Systems, but only a small number of them are enterprise-grade level that are used by large corporations. One of the most popular enterprise-grade Linux OS is called RHEL, and this OS is made by Red Hat. RHEL is short for "Red Hat Enterprise Linux".

RHEL is quite expensive to buy. However there are free alternatives such as <a href="http://www.centos.org/" rel="nofollow">CentOS</a> and <a href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/" rel="nofollow">Scientific Linux</a>. These alternatives are identical to RHEL in every way except that all the red hat logos and branding have been replaced.

<h2>Get Certified</h2>
The RHCSA certification is considered to be the gold started standard in validating your Linux skills in the Corporate IT world. Therefore this certification puts you in a strong position in the Linux and Devops job market.

There is also the next level up Red Had certification, which is RHCE.


<h2>Why CentOS</h2>
Throughout this course we will be using CentOS. But everything we do will also work in exactly the same way as RHEL.



<h2>How this course is structured</h2>
This course is based on the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/training/courses/ex200/examobjective" rel="nofollow">RHCSA exam objectives</a> course. This means that this series of tutorials covers everything you need to know to pass the RHCSA exam!


Each lesson is broken down into the following sections:
<ul>
	<li>Commands (that are introduced in this lesson)</li>
	<li>Config files (files that will be viewing/editing)</li>
	<li>Course notes (this is the lesson's main content)</li>
</ul>

In this course we will be primarily focused on showing how to do everything via the terminal because it is a much faster way to perform task and also we want you to get comfortable using the shell. However there are some tasks that are easier to do via the GUI.

In the next tutorial we list out all the RHCSA exam objectives along with what which tutorials cover each objective.
