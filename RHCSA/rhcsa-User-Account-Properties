Before you create a new user account, there's a few user account properties that you need to know:


<ul>
	<li>usernma</li>
	<li>password - in /etc/shodow, if it shows "!!" then it means that account doesn't have a password yet. You fix this by running the "passwd username" command as the root user</li>
	<li>uid</li>
	<li>guid - full list of guids are available in /etc/groups file</li>
	<li>home directory</li>
	<li>group name - a primary group is created at the same time as the user account, and it is named after the user account's username</li>
	<li>GECOS - a description for the user. </li>
	<li>home directory</li>
	<li>default shell</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
