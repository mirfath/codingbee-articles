If you have problems booting up your machine, then you can boot into the emergency.target. In this target you can explore your filesystem for possible issues.

In this filesystem, the root filesystem (/) has been mounted as root only mode. Therefore before you can make any fixes, then while in the emergency target, you will need to first run the following command:


<pre>
$ mount -o rw,remount /
</pre>

After that you can edit your config files, e.g. /etc/fstab or /etc/sudoers.
