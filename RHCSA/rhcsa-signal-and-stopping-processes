<h2>Intro</h2>
One thing you may want to do is to stop a process. This is done by sending a process a "signal". A signal is an instruction that can be sent to a process. Processes aren't allowed to ignore an incoming signal.


There's a standard set of signals you can send to a process. The kill command let's you view the full list of available signals:


<pre>
$ kill -l
 1) SIGHUP       2) SIGINT       3) SIGQUIT      4) SIGILL       5) SIGTRAP
 6) SIGABRT      7) SIGBUS       8) SIGFPE       9) SIGKILL     10) SIGUSR1
11) SIGSEGV     12) SIGUSR2     13) SIGPIPE     14) SIGALRM     15) SIGTERM
16) SIGSTKFLT   17) SIGCHLD     18) SIGCONT     19) SIGSTOP     20) SIGTSTP
21) SIGTTIN     22) SIGTTOU     23) SIGURG      24) SIGXCPU     25) SIGXFSZ

These signals are documented in section 7 of the  signal's man page:

<pre>
$ man 7 signal
</pre>

Here's an extract of the relevant part:


<pre>
   Standard signals
       Linux supports the standard signals listed below.  Several signal numbers are architecture-dependent, as indicated in the
       "Value" column.  (Where three values are given, the first one is usually valid for alpha and sparc, the  middle  one  for
       x86,  arm, and most other architectures, and the last one for mips.  (Values for parisc are not shown; see the Linux ker‐
       nel source for signal numbering on that architecture.)  A - denotes that a signal is absent on the  corresponding  archi‐
       tecture.)

       First the signals described in the original POSIX.1-1990 standard.


       Signal     Value     Action   Comment

       SIGHUP        1       Term    Hangup detected on controlling terminal
                                     or death of controlling process
       SIGINT        2       Term    Interrupt from keyboard
       SIGQUIT       3       Core    Quit from keyboard

       <strong>SIGTERM      15       Term    Termination signal</strong>
       SIGUSR1   30,10,16    Term    User-defined signal 1
       SIGUSR2   31,12,17    Term    User-defined signal 2
       SIGCHLD   20,17,18    Ign     Child stopped or terminated
       SIGCONT   19,18,25    Cont    Continue if stopped
       SIGSTOP   17,19,23    Stop    Stop process
       SIGTSTP   18,20,24    Stop    Stop typed at terminal
       SIGTTIN   21,21,26    Stop    Terminal input for background process
       SIGTTOU   22,22,27    Stop    Terminal output for background process

       The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

The most commonly used singals are 9 and 15. Signal 15 is the signal to send to a process, if you want that process to be gracefully terminated. Signal 9 is the signal you send if you want to forcefully terminate a process. These two signals are by far the main signals that are used. Signal 1 is also used occasionally and what this does is that it reloads any related config files.

It is best practice to always try signal 15, and issue signal 9 as last resort, due to signal 9's forceful nature.

Aside from that we hardly use any of the other signals. Now to send any of these signals to a process, you can can do it from withing the top command, simply type "k" after you have started up top. Alternatively you can use the "kill" command:

<pre>
$ kill {pid}
</pre>

In nearly all cases the signal we want to send to a process is a kill signal. That's why the command for sending a signal to a process is called "kill", which can be a bit misleading.

The kill command by default will always send signal 15 (i.e. graceful termination). If you want to send signal 9 (immediate forceful termination) instead, the you do it like this:


<pre>
$ kill -s 9 {pid}
</pre>



If you want kill a all processes of a certain name, then you can do this using the killall command:


<pre>
$ killall {process-name}

</pre>

Here's an example:


<pre>
$ vim &
[1] 4747
$ vim &
[2] 4748

[1]+  Stopped                 vim
$ vim &
[3] 4749

[2]+  Stopped                 vim
$ vim &
[4] 4750

[3]+  Stopped                 vim
$ jobs
[1]   Stopped                 vim
[2]   Stopped                 vim
[3]-  Stopped                 vim
[4]+  Stopped                 vim
$ killall -9 vim
[1]   Killed                  vim
[2]   Killed                  vim
[3]-  Killed                  vim
[4]+  Killed                  vim
$ jobs
$


</pre>

Notice that with the killall command, you don't specify the pid, instead you specify the process's name.


There is another command that is similar to the killall command and that is the pkill command:

<pre>
$ pkill {search-term}    
</pre>


This works in a similar way to the killall command. The main difference is that you can kill without knowing the full and proper name of the process.

Be careful when using thepkill command  because you might end up killing a process that you need. Hence it is best to first run the  <a href="http://codingbee.net/tutorials/rhcsa/rhcsa-processes/">pgrep -l {search-term}</a> command to confirm that you are going to kill the processes that you to kill.
