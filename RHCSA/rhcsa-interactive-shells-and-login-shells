<hr />











Whenever a new user is created, by default, a set of (usually hidden) config files will get copied to the user’s new home folder. These files are actually duplicate of all the files contained in the following directory:

/etc/skel

i.e. :

$ ls -l /etc/skel/

total 6

-rw-r--r--   1 root     sys              136 Nov 9 2006 local.cshrc

-rw-r--r--   1 root     sys              157 Nov 9 2006 local.login

-rw-r--r--   1 root     sys              174 Nov 9 2006 local.profile

the useradd commands automatically copies all the content from this folder and places it in the user’s home directory.

when a user logs into a RHEL machine (using username and password), the following scripts are executed automatically (in this order):

/etc/profile       # (this sets up user env variables, e.g. path, hostname, histsize….etc)…this script will also trigger:

/etc/profile.d     # (directory containing lots of other files.

{user’s home folder}/.bash_profile # can be used to add your own stuff including overriding what was set in the /etc/profile script.

{user’s home folder}/.bashrc     # (used for setting local variables e.g. the PS1 variables)

&nbsp;

However these does get executed when a non-login shell is generated. a non-login shell is a shell that gets opened buit without getting a username/password prompt. Here are some ways to start a non-login shell:

-         Applications=&gt;system tools=&gt;terminal

-        When you start a shell script, linux will automatically create a new shell for that script to run in, and this new shell is a non-login shell.

-         At the command line, type ksh, followed by bash.

In a non-login shell the following scripts are run:

&nbsp;

1. {user’s home folder}/bashrc,

2. /etc/bashrc,

3. /etc/profile.d (have a look through these script to familiarize yourself)
