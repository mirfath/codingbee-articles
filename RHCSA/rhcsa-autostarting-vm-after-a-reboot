By default when you restart your host machine, then any guest VMs that were running at the time won't automatically start up again after the reboot.

To make sure that your VMs do start up after a host machine's reboot, you need to do 2 things. First you need to ensure that the libvirtd daemon is enabled, so that it starts up after the reboot.

<pre>
$ systemctl start libvirtd.service
$ systemctl enable libvirtd.service
</pre>


Then you need to start a virsh interactive session and apply the autostart setting:

<pre>
# virsh
Welcome to virsh, the virtualisation interactive terminal.

Type:  'help' for help with commands
       'quit' to quit

virsh # list                     # only lists running vms.
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------

virsh # list --all               # lists all vms even those that are not currently running.
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 -     testVM                         shut off
virsh # autostart testVM
Domain testVM marked as autostarted
virsh #
</pre>

After this the vm will now autostart after a host machine's reboot.
