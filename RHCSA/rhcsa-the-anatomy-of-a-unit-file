A "unit" is a resource that systemd can manage.

If you look inside the <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system</code> directory, you will find files with different extensions, e.g. .socket, .target, .mount, ...etc. These are all the resources that systemd can manage, and in systemd they are referred by the generic term "unit". There are several different types of resources, however the files (i.e. units) that we are interested at the moment are the unit files ending with ".service":

<pre>
$ ls -l /usr/lib/systemd/system | grep ".service$"
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  275 Jun 18  2014 abrt-ccpp.service
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  380 Jun 18  2014 abrtd.service
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  361 Jun 18  2014 abrt-oops.service
.
.
.
...etc
</pre>


Each unit file contains all the information that's required for systemd to start/stop/enable (i.e. manage) that service.

The structure of a unit file varies slightly from one unit file to another, but in general it looks something like this:


<pre>
cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service
[Unit]
Description=OpenSSH server daemon
After=network.target sshd-keygen.service    # these units must be activated before this unit
Wants=sshd-keygen.service                 # systemd will attempt to start this at the same time as this unit.
                                          # but can still function without it.

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/sysconfig/sshd
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/sshd -D $OPTIONS
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=42s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</pre>

You can find documentation about these directives here:

<pre>
$ man systemd.unit
</pre>


The [Unit] sections gives a description of the service. It can also contain other settings, e.g. in this case it has an "After" setting.

The [Service] section defines the main definition of the service, which gives the systemctl command the info it needs to start/stop the service along with other things. This section is only found in .service files.

The [Install] section shows that this services has been assigned to a target. A target is essentially a way to group together a collection of services.



The <strong><em>WantedBy</em></strong> directive is particularly important. That's because it tells systemctl which "target"  it should make responsible for starting up the resource during boot time (if this unit is enabled).

Note: A <em>target</em> is something that lets you define what units (e.g. services, mounts, sockets,.....etc, and even includes other targtes) should be started/activated when you boot your machine. More about targets in the next article.

In the next article we'll cover exactly how systemctl makes a target responsible for starting up a unit.
