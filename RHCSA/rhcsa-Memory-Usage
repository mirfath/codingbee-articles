If you want to see how much ram your machine has installed and how much of it is being used, then you need to use the "free" command:


<pre>
$ free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            993         266         440           6         286         573
Swap:          2047           0        2047

</pre>


We used the -m option to output the info in megabytes.


In this case we have about 1gb of ram installed, of which 266MB is being used and 440MB is free.
