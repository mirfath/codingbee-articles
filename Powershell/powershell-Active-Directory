Active Directory is a type of LDAP.

You can query active directory using  set of powershell commands.

To do this you need to first turn on the AD windows feature. You do this on windows like this:

start -> control panel -> programs -> Program and Features -> Turn windows features on or off (left hand side column)








import the active directory module.
