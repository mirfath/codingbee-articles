Special Chapter - exiting out of outerloop

when exiting out of an outer loop, you are effecting exiting out from all the inner loops.

You do this by labeling your loops like this:

$list = 1,2,3,4,5

# here we use the ":{loops label}" syntax to give a loop a name, then refer to it when we do continue/break
:outerloop foreach ($i in $list) {
  for ($j = 0; $j -lt 5; $j++) {
    if ($j -eq 2) {
      continue outerloop  	# notice here that we are specifying which loop to apply continue to.
    }
    Write-Host "outer loop counter = $i, inner loop counter = $j"
  }
}
