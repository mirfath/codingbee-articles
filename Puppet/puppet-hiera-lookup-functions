By default, puppet only submits a hiera query when it is trying to find a value for a class parameter. OUtside of that, hiera doesn't get used by puppet. As for your manifests, you will mainly be using data available from facter and puppet built-in variables.


However if there is certain data that you want to use in your manifests, but are stored in yaml files. Then you can instruct puppet to perform a hiera lookup using a number of functions:

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/function.html#hiera">hiera</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/function.html#hieraarray">hiera_array</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/function.html#hierahash">hiera_hash</a></li>

</ul>


There is a fourth a hiera related function, which is called "<a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/function.html#hierainclude">hiera_include</a>". <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/puppet.html#assigning-classes-to-nodes-with-hiera-hierainclude">Hiera include can assign classes to nodes</a>.  Will cover more about that later.
