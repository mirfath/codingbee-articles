the ntp module is an example of a really well written module.


https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/module_guides/bgtm.html



any yum related activicivities should reside  in it's own manifest called: <code>install.pp</code>
any config file related activities should reside in it's own manifest called: <code>config.pp</code>
any service start/stop related activities should reside in it's own manifest called: <code>service.pp</code>


These are best practice, although I don't think they are mandatory.


All class parameters should have default values, so that people can use the module just be calling "include class_name". All the default parameter values should be defined in it's own manifest, which we should call <code>params.pp</code>.
