<h2>querying puppetdb with postgres command line, psql</h2>

psql -h localhost -U puppetdb puppetdb

However to connect to puppet enterprise's puppetdb, then follow:

However a better approach, as discussed in the documentation, is first create a json file with your query, e.g:


<pre>$ cat puppetdbquery.json
["and",
  ["=", "certname", "example.com"],
  ["=", "type", "file"],
  ["=", "exported", true]
]
</pre>


Then run:


<pre>
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/pdb/query/v4/resources --data-urlencode query@puppetdbquery.json  --data-urlencode 'pretty=true'
</pre>
