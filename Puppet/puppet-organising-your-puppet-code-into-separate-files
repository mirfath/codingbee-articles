So far we have looked at how to organise your code by compartmentalizing your resources into classes.

However, your site.pp can still get really big as your write more and more classes. That's why the next logical step is to store your classes in separate manifests, and then "dot source" them. In Puppet there are three ways to do this:

<ul>
	<li>Using the <a href="http://codingbee.net/tutorials/puppet/puppet-using-import-keyword/" title="Puppet – Using the “import” keyword">import</a> keyword</li>
	<li>The "<a href="http://codingbee.net/tutorials/puppet/puppet-puppet-apply-approach/" title="Puppet – The “puppet apply” approach">apply puppet</a>" method</li>
	<li><a href="http://codingbee.net/tutorials/puppet/puppet-modules/" title="Puppet – Modules">Modules</a> - this is the best approach</li>
</ul>

We'll now look at each approach in turn.
