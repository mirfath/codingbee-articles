this is common, for example, sometimes once class installs dbg software, and then the next class creates the db istself.


<pre>
class mainclass {
  include class1
  include class2
  include class3
  include class4

  Class['class1']
  -> Class['class2']
  -> Class['class3']
  -> Class['class4']
} </pre>
