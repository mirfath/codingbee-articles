Complete list of environment variables (aka "FACTS"): <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/latest/core_facts.html">https://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/latest/core_facts.html</a>

"facter" is a standalone package. This means that it isn't a puppet subcommand but is actually a command in it's own right.

If you you:

&nbsp;

[bash]# facter[/bash]

then it will output a list of all environment variable (similar to linux's "env" command).

In the selectors example it showed:

&nbsp;
<pre>
$apache = $operatingsystem ? {
      centos                => 'httpd',
      redhat                => 'httpd',
      /(?i)(ubuntu|debian)/ => 'apache2',
      default               => undef,
    }
</pre>
Here we are trying to determine what value that "$apache" can take. This depends on the value of the $operatingsystem (which is a builtin variable, aka fact).

&nbsp;

The third line shows "/...../". This is actually a regex. TheÂ  "?i" is acutally a regex switch that <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/modifiers.html">enables case-sensitivity</a>, a bit like the "-i" switch for bash's grep command.
