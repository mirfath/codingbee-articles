External facts is a great way to apply (arbitary) meta data to a vm during the vm provisioning stage (e.g. using vsphere/openstack/aws....etc).

These meta data can then be used by puppet to determine what needs to be added into the catalog.

it's really simple to create an external fact:

step 1:

On the agent, create the following directory (if it doesn't already exist):

<pre>
$ mkdir -p /etc/facter/facts.d
</pre>

In this directory, create a shell script, of any name. In this example I created the following script:

<pre>
$ ls -l /etc/facter/facts.d
total 4
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 65 Sep 18 13:11 external-facts.sh
$ cat /etc/facter/facts.d/external-facts.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "hostgroup=dev"
echo "environment=development"

</pre>

Then make the script executable:

<pre>
$ chmod u+x /etc/facter/facts.d/external-facts.sh
</pre>

You will now see that these key/value pairs are now available via facter:


<pre>
$ facter hostgroup
dev
$ facter environment
development
</pre>



Note: An <a href="http://codingbee.net/tutorials/puppet/puppet-format-of-the-enc-output/#The_8220parameters8221_key">External Node Classifier, such as foreman can also set metadata</a>. But external facts is probably a better approach, becuase data gets stored on the agents, and mcollective can make use of facter data as well.
