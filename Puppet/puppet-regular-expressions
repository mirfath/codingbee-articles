&nbsp;

In bash you encase regular expressions in double-quotes. However in puppet you encase them in forward slashes. I.e. this is wrong:

&nbsp;

"regex"

&nbsp;

but this is correct:

&nbsp;

/regex/

This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Syntax">perl syntax of regex</a>
