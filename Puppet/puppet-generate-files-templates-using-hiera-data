You can use hiera data to populate the placeholders in your template files. For

For example if your class looks like this:

<pre>
# your class contains:
[root@puppetmaster user_account]# cat manifests/init.pp
class user_account ($username) {

  user { $username:
    ensure => present,
    shell  => '/bin/bash',
  }

  file {"/tmp/$username.txt":
    ensure => file,
    content => template("user_account/list-of-fruits.erb"),
  }

}

# your template contains:
[root@puppetmaster user_account]# cat templates/list-of-fruits.erb
<%-# Here is a simple ruby for-loop -%>
<%- for fruit in scope.function_hiera(["fruits"]) -%>
  A <%= fruit %> is a fruit.
<%- end -%>


# your global yaml file contains:
[root@puppetmaster user_account]# cat /etc/hieradata/yaml/global.yaml
---
user_account::username: homer

fruits:
  - pineapple
  - banana
  - carrot


</pre>

First notice that the fruits key holds an array. Also notice the hiera lookup syntax we used inside the erb file. When we want to call a function from inside an erb file, we have to always have to prefix the function name with "scope.function_" and the key has to be encased in double/single quotes followed by square brackets, and finally round brackets.

When we then run this, we get:

<pre>
[root@puppetmaster user_account]# cat /tmp/homer.txt
cat: /tmp/homer.txt: No such file or directory
[root@puppetmaster user_account]# puppet agent -t

[root@puppetmaster user_account]# cat /tmp/homer.txt
  A pineapple is a fruit.
  A banana is a fruit.
  A carrot is a fruit.
[root@puppetmaster user_account]#
</pre>

However calling hiera lookups within erb files is not considered good practice.
