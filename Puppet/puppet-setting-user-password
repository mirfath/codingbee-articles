When you use the user resource, you'll notice that it contains a password attribute. This can only be used to enter an encrypted password, aka a hashed password. For security reasons, you cannot use a plain text password.

Also for some reason, you can't use the passwd command to create hash value and retrieve that value from teh /etc/shadow file either. However Puppet passes the password supplied in the user type definition into the /etc/shadow file.

You have to use the openssl command to generate the hash:

<pre>
#openssl passwd -1
#Enter your password here
Password:
Verifying - Password:
 $1$HTumvYUGYUGwsxQxCp3F/nGc4DCYM
</pre>

You then insert this password into your resource:

<pre>user { 'TestUser':
  ensure   => present,
  password => '$1$HTumvYUGYUGwsxQxCp3F/nGc4DCYM',
}</pre>
