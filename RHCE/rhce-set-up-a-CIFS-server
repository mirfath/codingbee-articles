CIFS is a system that's designed to let you share folders over the internet between machines. It is cross platform, i.e. you can share a Microsoft windows folder with a Linux machine.


First you need to install:

<pre>
$ yum install -y samba
</pre>

This package installs a few dependent rpms. One of which is the samba-common rpm. This rpm in turn installs the following config file:


<pre>
$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too
# many!) most of which are not shown in this example
#
# For a step to step guide on installing, configuring and using samba,
# read the Samba-HOWTO-Collection. This may be obtained from:
#  http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf
#
# Many working examples of smb.conf files can be found in the
# Samba-Guide which is generated daily and can be downloaded from:
#  http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/Samba-Guide.pdf
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash)
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentry and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command "testparm"
# to check that you have not made any basic syntactic errors.
#
.

.
</pre>


At the very end of your <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>, append the following:


<pre>
[{folder_name}]
path = /path/to/{folder_name}
available = yes
valid users = {user_name}
read only = no
browseable = yes
public = yes
writable = yes
</pre>

In the world of CIFS, we use existing machine login user accounts, as a means to authenticate yourself. In our example, we will use an existing account called "vagrant":

<pre>
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep vagrant
vagrant:x:1000:1000:vagrant:/home/vagrant:/bin/bash
</pre>

Let's say we want to share a folder called "/CIFS/Shared-Folder". Therefore in our scenario we will end up appending the following:

<pre>
[Shared-Folder]
path = /CIFS/Shared-Folder
available = yes
valid users = vagrant
read only = no
browseable = yes
public = yes
writable = yes
</pre>


Next create the folder you want to share. In my case I create the following folder.

<pre>
$ mkdir -p /CIFS/Shared-Folder
$ chmod 777 /CIFS/Shared-Folder
</pre>

Note: The "vagrant" user needs to have the appropriate permission for this folder.


When using samba, we have to create a different password for our Linux account, which we do like this:

<pre>
$ smbpasswd -a vagrant
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
Added user vagrant.
</pre>


Next we enable + restart the service:


<pre>
$ systemctl enable smb
ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/smb.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/smb.service'
$ systemctl start smb
</pre>

Now from another server that has the smblcient installed, check if it can see the new share:


<pre>
$ smbclient -L puppetagent01 --user vagrant
Enter vagrant's password:
Domain=[MYGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.1.12]

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        Shared-Folder   Disk
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba Server Version 4.1.12)
        vagrant         Disk      Home Directories
Domain=[MYGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.1.12]

        Server               Comment
        ---------            -------

        Workgroup            Master
        ---------            -------
</pre>


Success, you can access the CIFS folder.
