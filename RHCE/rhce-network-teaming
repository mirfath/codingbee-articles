<strong>Link Aggregation</strong>

In RHEL/CentOS it is possible to combine two (physical or virtual) network interfaces so that they act as one. Having 2 network interfaces acting as one is referred toÂ as <strong>link aggregation</strong>. There's 2 advantages to setting up link aggregations:
<ul>
 	<li>Improved redundancy - i.e. one interface is active, and the other is on standby. if the active interface fails, then then standby interface takes over.</li>
 	<li>Improved performance - i.e. having two interface acting as one will double the bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

There are 2 ways to setup two interfaces to act as one:
<ul>
 	<li>bonding</li>
 	<li>teaming</li>
</ul>
Bonding is the old approach that has been around for a long while, whereas the Teaming is the newer approach. In this article we'll take a look at how to setup link aggregation via the teaming approach.

Teaming can be configured using Network Manager. That is, we can setup teaming using the nmcli, nmtui, or the graphical network manager tool.
